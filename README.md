# Shigoto

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hiteshpaul/shigoto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hiteshpaul/shigoto)

Shigoto is a command line task management utility. Currently it is in its early stages of development and hence it is unstable.

# Usage

First, lets start with the three basic usage: `add`, `done` and `list`

## Adding a Task

```bash
sg add "Buy milk"
```

## Listing all Tasks 

```bash
sg list
```

## Marking a Task as Done

```bash
sg done task_id
```
